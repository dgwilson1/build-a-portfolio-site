					<p style=" margin-right: 40em; color: black"> Hello my name is Darrius Wilson. I am from Queens, New York and am 20 years old. I am a creative person and interested in the digital advertising track. Digital advertising is my main interest because marketing is appealing and I would also like to incorporate creativity into my professional life. I joined Year Up because I knew and believed that this opportunity was amazing and could lead me on a path to success. With this program I am able to achieve a life long dream of owning my own record label. I would like to own a record label because I feel that my love and passion for music could be mixed with my drive to influence change in society. I would like to make a change that would allow the youth to have a voice in the music world. I have been making beats and writing raps, poems, and music for years and have been learning and working towards my goal. Year Up is a shot that makes this dream a tangible opportunity.</p>
